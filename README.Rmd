Earth System History Variables

(Ádám T. Kocsis and Nussaïbah B. Raja)

The purpose of the 'chronosphere' package is to facilitate spatially explicit analyses of deep time paleoenvironmental/paleoecological research. 

The project is developed under the umbrella of the DFG Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332) in collaboration with Christopher Scotese and Paul Valdes. The package will serve as a gateway to deep time global climate model results and plate tectonic/paleonvironmental reconstructions. It also implements query functions to the GPlates Web Service allowing users to reconstruct coordinates without leaving the R environment. 

This is a beta version. Much of the functionality is not yet available/perfect and data access is restricted to publicly available datasets only. 

See the blog entry below for an example application:

# Installing

## Stable version

The stable version of the package is available from the CRAN repositories, which you can instal with this line, after you open R:

```r
install.packages("chronosphere")
```

## In development version

The devel-version can be installed from the source archive deposited on this github repository. Open R and paste in: 
```r
install.packages("https://github.com/chronosphere-portal/r_package/raw/devel/_archive/source/chronosphere_0.4.1.tar.gz", repos=NULL, type="source")
```

## After install
You should be able to attach it with the regular library function:
```r
library(chronosphere)
```

# Usage

Run datasets() to see the publicly available variables.
