R interface for the GPlates Web Service and Console Application 

(Ádám T. Kocsis and Nussaïbah B. Raja)

The purpose of the 'rgplates' package is to facilitate spatially explicit analyses of deep time paleoenvironmental/paleoecological research. 

The project is developed under the umbrella of the DFG Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332). It implements query functions to the GPlates Web Service and interfaces to the GPlates desktop application, allowing users to reconstruct coordinates and spatial objects without leaving the R environment. 

This is a beta version.
