#' R Interface for the GPlates Web Service and Desktop Application 
#'
#' Query functions to the GPlates <https://www.gplates.org/> Desktop Application and the GPlates Web Service <https://gws.gplates.org/> allow users to reconstruct coordinates, static plates, Simple Features and Spatial objects without leaving the R running environment. This R extension is developed under the umbrella of the DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332, TEmperature Related Stressors in ANcient Extinctions).
#' 
#' This is still the Beta version. As is R, this is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. Nevertheless, notes about found bugs and suggestions are more than welcome.
