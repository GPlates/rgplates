Originally, all functions in `rgplates` were developed in the envelope of the `chronosphere` project. However, since the project's inception the functionality of these modules diverged: `rgplates` contains functions to execute plate tectonic reconstructions with R, and the `chronosphere` is a data distribution and versioning system. The two are connected with the tectonic model data: we will download and import these with the `chronosphere` and use them with `rgplates`. 


<br>


# Loading packages

* * *

For this highly optimized workflow, both the `rgplates` and the `chronosphere` R package are required.

```{r loadBoth, echo=TRUE}
library(rgplates)
library(chronosphere)
```

<br>

# Downloading data 

* * * 

Detailed tutorials will be made available later about how to use the chronosphere-portal. For now, all we need to know, is how to access the `platemodel`-class objects.

Downloading data iwth the `chronosphere` is easy: all you need is a single line of code, with the appropriate IDs of your data of choice. The following expression will download a more detailed tectonic model (feature collections and reconstruction tree) which were used by [Merdith et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825220305237):

```{r dlModel1, echo=TRUE}
pm <- chronosphere::fetch(src="EarthByte", ser="MERDITH2021")
```

The arguments of `chronosphere::fetch()` are the the source (`src`), series (`ser`) and version (`ver`) ID of the item that you want to download.

<br>

```{r dlModel2, echo=TRUE}
pm
```

This tectonic model has some additional feature collections that can be reconstructed on demand. To make the use of this `platemodel` class more straightforward, it also includes information on the feature collections' time frame of validity.


# Actual reconstruction

* * *

The model can be used with the [offline reconstruction method](articles/3_offline_reconstruction.html) (you need to have GPlates installed for this!). Names of the feature collections can be passed as the subject of reconstruction. For instance to get the `"static_polygons"` feature collection you would have to use:


```{r offRec, echo=TRUE, plot=TRUE}
# reconstruct the plates and plot them
pl100<- rgplates::reconstruct("static_polygons", age=100, model=pm)
```

which includes all static plate polygons that existed at 100Ma. This can be plotted with:

```{r statPol, echo=TRUE, plot=TRUE}
plot(pl100$geometry, col="gray70", border=NA)
```

Additional feature collections can be reconstructed just as easily. For instance, if you are interested in the positions of the continental plates (`"continents"`) and the reconstructed positions of the present-day coastlines (`"coastlines"`), respectively:


```{r other, echo=TRUE, plot=TRUE}
continents100 <- rgplates::reconstruct("continents", age=100, model=pm)
coastlines100 <- rgplates::reconstruct("coastlines", age=100, model=pm)
```


These you can plot on top of the original maps with:

```{r plotOtherNo, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
plot(continents100$geometry, col="#bc683a", border=NA, add=TRUE)
plot(coastlines100$geometry, col="#63351c", border=NA, add=TRUE)
```

```{r plotOther, echo=FALSE, plot=TRUE}
plot(pl100$geometry, col="gray70", border=NA)
plot(continents100$geometry, col="#bc683a", border=NA, add=TRUE)
plot(coastlines100$geometry, col="#63351c", border=NA, add=TRUE)
```


# Concluding remarks

* * *

There! With a couple lines of code, you can download the tectonic information, calculate the rotations and plot the reconstructed geometries. Simple.

This is how we originally intended to use the `reconstruct()` function's offline method, and this is what we recommend to adopt as a general workflow. 

Note that we intend to add as many models to the `chronosphere`, which was recently overhauled to make it as flexible and useful as possible.
