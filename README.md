R interface for the GPlates Web Service and Console Application

(Ádám T. Kocsis and Nussaïbah B. Raja)

The purpose of the ‘rgplates’ package is to facilitate spatially
explicit analyses of deep time paleoenvironmental/paleoecological
research. The functions here were removed from the chronosphere R
package (v0.4.1), for better compliance with UNIX-principles and more
efficient distribution/development.

This R extension was supported by the FAU GeoZentrum Nordbayern and is
developed under the umbrella of the DFG (Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft) Research Unit TERSANE2 (For 2332, TEmperature
Related Stressors in ANcient Extinctions).

This is a beta version.
