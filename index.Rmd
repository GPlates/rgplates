#### R interface for the *GPlates Web Service* and the *GPlates Desktop Application*

## About

Functions to the [GPlates Desktop Application](https://www.gplates.org/) and the [GPlates Web Service](https://gws.gplates.org/) allow users to reconstruct past positions of geographic entities based on user-selected rotation models without leaving the R running environment. 

The **online reconstruction** (GPlates Web Service) makes the rotation of static plates, coastlines, and a low number of geographic coordinates available using nothing but an internet connection. 

The **offline reconstruction** requires an external installation of the GPlates Desktop Application, but allows the efficient batch rotation of thousands of coordinates, Simple Features ([`sf`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf)) and Spatial ([`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp)) objects with custom reconstruction trees and partitioning polygons. Examples of such plate tectonic models are accessible via the [chronosphere-portal](https://cran.r-project.org/package=chronosphere). 

## History, notes and plans

The functions here were originally developed and published under the the [chronosphere] R package.  (v0.4.1), for better compliance with UNIX-principles and more efficient distribution/development.

This is a beta version, and like R, comes with absolutely no warranty.

The package was developed to make R-based analyses that require paloecoordinate rotations easier to implement, i.e. for applying a rotation model - but not as a replacement of tools dedidacted to complex paleogeographic reconstruction and model development. For more complex analyses you are more than welcome to check out [pyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/), the awesome python module developed by the GPlates team.
